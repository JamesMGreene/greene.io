### Technical Prowess
 - I am a JavaScript language expert, for both the frontend (browsers) and back (Node.js, PhantomJS, etc.).
   Check out my [open source work][cover-letter/open-source] and my [best project narrative][cover-letter/best-project]
   for more details.
 - I am extremely proficient at learning new programming languages and frameworks.
 - I am a practitioner of unit testing, though I know from experience that it doesn't always pan out as well we hope.
 - I am a regular GitHub.com user but I accomplish most of my Git interactions from the terminal.
 - I am extraordinarily detail-oriented.


### Personality
 - I am an easy-going person and enjoy working with others, though I have also been an "individual contributor" for
   much of my professional career.
 - I have experience leading small teams (1-10 devs) on focused features/refactors/projects.
 - I refuse to stop [learning][cover-letter/learning], and I strive to find a healthy balance between the breadth and depth
   of the knowledge that I absorb.
 - I am very passionate about creating _and shipping_ high quality software; a desire which is complemented well by my
   detail-oriented nature.
 - I am _obsessed_ with the three Cs of open source: [creating, contributing, and consuming][cover-letter/open-source].
 - I have an unabashed love for JavaScript that most engineers consider unhealthy.
